conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y

Hereâ€™s what each part of the command does:

-p venv: This specifies that the new environment should be created in a directory named venv.
python==3.8: This ensures that the Python version 3.8 is installed in the newly created environment.
-y: The -y flag automatically confirms any prompts during the environment creation process.
In summary, this command creates a new virtual environment named venv with Python version 3.8 installed. The -p flag specifies the path where this environment will be located. You can then activate this environment to work with your specific Python version.
